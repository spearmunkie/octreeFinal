octreeFinal
===========

This was an optimization I did in grade 12 for my first graphics engine. That one barely ran on the school computers, and it was because I was sending too many polygons to the graphics card. I implemented an octree class to fix this. In the end I got it running at a decent speed.

The exe should run in windows. I also had a map editer to edit levels. I believe you could press 'f' to free the camera, and 'o' to draw the bounding volumes, nad space to fire.
